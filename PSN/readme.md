# Proteins structural network construction  

**ntf_file.py** --- py to generate network file. It counts the number of atomic contacts present in a pair of non-adjacent amino acids.  
**max_contact.py** --- py to find the max number of contacts for a pair of residues in the whole dataset, create heatmap and use this information to normalize the edge weights (num contacts) by max number of contacts.  
**degree.py** --- py to find degree of each residue in each domain in the whole dataset and create degree files.  
**adj_mat.py** --- py to create adcency matrix, degree matrix.
